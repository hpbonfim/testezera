# REST API Example

This example shows how to implement a **REST API with TypeScript** using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client). The example uses an SQLite database file with some initial dummy data which you can find at [`./prisma/dev.db`](./prisma/dev.db).

## Getting started

(when update schema)
```
npx prisma generate 
```

### 1. install dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

### 2. Create and seed the database

Run the following command to create your SQLite database file. This also creates the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

When `npx prisma migrate dev` is executed against a newly created database, seeding is also triggered. The seed file in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) will be executed and your database will be populated with the sample data.


### 3. Start the REST API server

```
pnpm dev
```

### (optional). Start the Prisma Studio

```
npx prisma studio
```

### (optional) Build and run Docker Image
```
docker build . -t testezera/backend

docker run -p 3000:3000 -d testezera/backend
```

The server is now running on `http://localhost:3000`. You can now run the API requests, e.g. [`http://localhost:3000/feed`](http://localhost:3000/feed).

## Using the REST API

You can access the REST API of the server using the following endpoints:

### `GET`

- `/post/:id`: Fetch a single post by its `id`
- `/feed?searchString={searchString}&take={take}&skip={skip}&orderBy={orderBy}`: Fetch all _published_ posts
  - Query Parameters
    - `searchString` (optional): This filters posts by `title` or `content`
    - `take` (optional): This specifies how many objects should be returned in the list
    - `skip` (optional): This specifies how many of the returned objects in the list should be skipped
    - `orderBy` (optional): The sort order for posts in either ascending or descending order. The value can either `asc` or `desc`
- `/user/:id/drafts`: Fetch user's drafts by their `id`
- `/users`: Fetch all users
### `POST`

- `/post`: Create a new post
  - Body:
    - `title: String` (required): The title of the post
    - `content: String` (optional): The content of the post
    - `authorEmail: String` (required): The email of the user that creates the post
- `/signup`: Create a new user
  - Body:
    - `email: String` (required): The email address of the user
    - `name: String` (optional): The name of the user
    - `postData: PostCreateInput[]` (optional): The posts of the user

### `PUT`

- `/publish/:id`: Toggle the publish value of a post by its `id`
- `/post/:id/views`: Increases the `viewCount` of a `Post` by one `id`

### `DELETE`

- `/post/:id`: Delete a post by its `id`
